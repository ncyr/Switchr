-- Installation --

  - Download to local disk
  - decompress and name resulting folder "forums" (Optional,  recompress and save file as forums.zip)
  - place in addons/<site_ref>/modules/  OR addons/shared_addons/modules/ OR (if recompressed) upload via control panel
  - install via admin panel.

-- ToDo --
  - Settings: allow access to forums for logged in/not logged in as chosen by site admin
  - Convert to streams
  - Update views to use Bootstrap and/or other CSS (IE: lose the tables layout)
  - Drag and drop to reorder categories and Forums (Currently, first in = top of list, last in = bottom of list)
  - Add moderator functionality (currently, it's site admin or nothing.  Most don't want to give that kind of access to just anyone)
